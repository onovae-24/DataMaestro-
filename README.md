 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Honour's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

My journey into data science began with an insatiable curiosity as a young coder, eager to unravel the intricacies of data analysis, particularly within real estate. Immersed in datasets, I honed my Python skills and delved into statistical theories, fueled by a fervent ambition to extract meaningful insights.

While my initial focus was on real estate analysis, I found myself captivated by the broader realm of machine learning and predictive modeling. Exploring various algorithms, I gradually steered my path towards becoming a data scientist.

Amidst my academic endeavors, a persistent dream lingered – to create my own data-driven application, one that could redefine how insights are derived in the real estate sector. However, with graduation on the distant horizon, I opted to fortify my skills by securing internships and taking on projects, rather than rushing into traditional employment.

As I continue on this journey, propelled by passion and purpose, I extend an invitation to join me. In the world of data science, as in life, the greatest discoveries await those who dare to chase their dreams.
